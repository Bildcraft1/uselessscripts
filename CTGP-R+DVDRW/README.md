# CTGP-R + Burned DVD+RW/DVD+R

So, you want to play CTGP-R but you don't have a original disk, so you cant, but there is a way to use it anyway (btw i recommend that you have atleast a brick protection (Like Priiloader) and BootMii), because we are going to install cIOS, i recommend that you install Piiloader and RC24 before this, since we are going to overwrite some file

### **I take no responsibility if you brick your Wii**

So let's see how to get this working then

## Before installing DarkCorp

You will need a burned DVD with Mario Kart Wii on it (you can find it in 1ms on google lol, so don't ask in the issues the link of the game)

**You will need to write the disk at a 2x speed otherwise the Wii can't read it**

And you can only do this hack just if you have any Drive Chip other than the D3-2, if you have a D3-2 (and you can check the drive on this [website]( https://www.wiidrives.com/list?v_perpage=100))

## Installing DarkCorp

So, you can find the download link in the link.txt file on the repo, when you have downloaded the Zip Package do this:

* Open the Zip
* Copy the contents to your SD Card Root (So the Apps folder and the DARKCORP-v1.1
* Unplug the SD card from your PC and put it on the Wii
* Open HBC and launch the DarkCorp Installer
* Select the second option (Install/Upgrade to DARKCORP v1.1 (regular mode))
* Install it (it takes time‚Ñ¢Ô∏è)

After this congratulations you have successfuly installed DARKCORP, here take a medal ü•á

## Loading CTGP-R with DARKCORP IOS

So, know that we have DARKCORP we need to say to the CTGP-R Launcher to use that IOS, so for this we will need to use MMM (Multi Mod Manager), download it from the repo and put it on your apps folder (on your SD card of course), and then download the CTGP-R package from the links.txt file and put it in the SD and then do this:

* Open MMM on the Wii from HBC
* Go all the way down to Load another IOS (or you can press the Left arrow on the DPAD)
* Load IOS36 since is one of the IOS patched by DARKCORP
* Go to APP Manager
* Load CTGP-R App (It might take a while to open)

And after a while you will find the CTGP-R app, and if you go to Launch Game with a burned dvd it will just start without saying anything

### Non-Feature List

The only feature that you can't use is installing the CTGP-R Channel (which is just a forwarder so if you can make your own forwarder you can make the channel) because it will use a IOS which is not patched by DARKCORP

Well, after all of this mess now you can play CTGP-R without an original disk, for now i'm working to find a way to load ISO from a USB using SNEEK (So with a virtual nand we can spoof the USB drive as if it is a DVD Drive and we can load games from it)

Congratulations if you have succesfuly installed all of this, just for saying, i recommend to buy a normal disk, they don't cost a lot nowdays or go to support the developer of CTGP-R [here](https://www.paypal.com/donate?token=k3AzdVCt5QAzDbkLF5Z8kc0ikblZvMQjNC1LRRb41cra2fkBW6hjKBVe2GOhzDAlbrZXcT2tNlpVXWx4)
